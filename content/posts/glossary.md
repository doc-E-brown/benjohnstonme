The following are terms that are not part of any programming language, but are used by engineers to describe more meta aspects of a project or task.

# A - X

# Y

- **Yak Shaving**: the process of completing many small and often seemingly unrelated tasks before completing the actual task of interest.
Yak Shaving may be necessary e.g. you want to complete feature X, but to complete feature X you notice you need to fix bug Y, but to fix bug Y you need to bump dependency Z and before you know it you are "shaving the yak".
Yak Shaving may also be used as a procrastination technique to avoid completing feature X, especially if an argument can be made that the seemingly unrelated tasks are in fact related.

# Z
